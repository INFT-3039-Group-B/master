at the new york mercantile  exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number   the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the  forecast was for frigid weather traders put the two together anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights   traders do that all the time theyre looking forward said william burson  a trader it makes the market for natural gas   but the markets response perplexed chris mcgill the american gas  associations director of gas supply and transportation he had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994 and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality   its a little frustrating that they dont take the time to understand what  we are reporting mcgill said   as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills the hunt for reasons     and culprits    is on some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at wall street   stephen adik senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for  the rise in gas prices   its my firm belief  that todays gas prices are being manipulated adik  told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly   in california where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis six investigations are looking into the power industry   closer to home observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winters startling gas bills having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes   most utilities often with the acquiescence of regulators failed to take  precautions such as fixed rate contracts and hedging    a sort of price  insurance    that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared   were passing on our gas costs which we have no control over said paul  snider a spokesman for missouri gas energy   but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers   theres been a failure of risk management by utilities and that needs to  change said ed krapels director of gas power services for energy security  analysis inc an energy consulting firm in wakefield mass    hot topic   consumers know one thing for certain their heating bills are up sharply in  many circles little else is discussed   the rev vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is  facing a 1456 december bill for heating the church    more than double the  previous decembers bill church members are suffering from higher bills as  well   the sunday collection is down said fraser who might have to forgo part of  his salary for the first time the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating   its the talk of the town here he said   a year ago that wasnt a fear wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per  thousand cubic feet    a level that producers say didnt make it worthwhile  to drill for gas utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers   but trouble was brewing by spring gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand  cubic feet just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter   there was a dip in the fall but then prices rebounded by early november  prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet the federal energy information  administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher   but 10 gas was coming below normal temperatures hit much of the country  including the kansas city area and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets   its all about the weather said krapels of energy security analysis   wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet led by the new york  traders natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price volatile  commodity in the world    setting the price   in the 1980s the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas allowing it to float in 1990 the new york mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices   the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce and big gas consumers from  utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use   there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas    and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas   but if they get on the right side of a price trend traders dont need to  know much about gas    or whatever commodity theyre trading like all  futures the gas contracts are purchased on credit that leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time   as december began the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than 7 per thousand cubic feet by the end of the month it was nearly 10  much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas associations  weekly storage numbers   utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter   going into the winter the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing in  hopes that the summers unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop   still the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient but when below normal temperatures arrived in november the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient   then the american gas association reported the lowest year end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994 still said the  associations mcgill there was sufficient gas in storage   but some utility executives didnt share that view william eliason vice  president of kansas gas service said that if decembers cold snap had  continued into january there could have been a real problem meeting demand   i was getting worried he said   then suddenly the market turned when januarys weather turned warmer  wednesdays storage numbers were better than expected and futures prices  dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet    just passing through   some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers   among area utilities kansas gas service increased its customers cost of gas  charge earlier this month to 868 per thousand cubic feet and missouri gas  energy has requested an increase to 981 to begin wednesday   sheila lumpe chairwoman of the missouri public service commission said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level payment plan and to conserve  energy   kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place which is expected to  save an average customer about 25 this winter   missouri gas energy has no hedging program it waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs   now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills and regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs   on friday doug micheel senior counsel of the missouri office of the public  counsel said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to  perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energys gas purchasing practices   consumers are taking all the risk micheel said its time to consider  some changes    to reach steve everly call 816 234 4455 or send e mail to
